API Used: https://openweathermap.org/api

# Motivation
My motivation behind this project was to find a clean way to get weather information from the OpenWeather API. 

# Purpose of Building this Project
I wanted to not only get better at implementing api's but also getting them to display through HTML and CSS in a professional and pleasing manor.

# Problem this solves
The ideal situation this is used in, is when someone wants a clean display of both the current weather and the future 5-day forcast of any given location.

# What have I learned? 
I learned a lot about trying not to repeat myself in my code; although this may not be the best display of that. I am becoming a lot better at utilizing API's and I do think that shows at least in this project. I also learned a few more ways to style things with CSS and HTML, although most of my learning was defintily based in JavaScript for this particular project

# What Makes My Project Stand out?
I think a big part of what will make my project stand out is the simplicity of the site itself. It's extremely straightforward and has little to no room for confusion. The hope is that the user will completely understand how to utilize the site the instant they visit it.

# Challenges 
A big issue I had in this project was getting local storage to work. I've left the code I tried commented in the JavaScript but clearly I still have a way to go with my current understanding. I plan on hopefully returning to this once I've gained more insight on LocalStorage
